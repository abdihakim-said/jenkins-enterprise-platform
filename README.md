- Docker (for security scanning tools)

### Deployment

1. **Clone and navigate to the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jenkins-enterprise-platform
   cd jenkins-enterprise-platform
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   # Edit terraform.tfvars with your specific values
   vim environments/staging/terraform.tfvars
   ```

3. **Deploy infrastructure**
   ```bash
   cd environments/staging

   # Get admin password
   aws ssm get-parameter --name '/jenkins/staging/admin-password' --with-decryption --query 'Parameter.Value' --output text --region us-east-1
   ```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment-Specific Configurations

**Development Environment** (`environments/dev/terraform.tfvars`):
```hcl
environment = "dev"
vpc_cidr = "10.1.0.0/16"
jenkins_instance_type = "t3.small"
jenkins_desired_capacity = 1
health_check_grace_period = 600  # 10 minutes
```

**Production Environment** (`environments/production/terraform.tfvars`):
```hcl
environment = "production"
vpc_cidr = "10.3.0.0/16"
jenkins_instance_type = "t3.large"
jenkins_desired_capacity = 2
health_check_grace_period = 1200  # 20 minutes
single_nat_gateway = false  # Multi-AZ NAT for HA
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Logging

### Cost-Optimized Observability Stack
- **CloudWatch Dashboard**: `${environment}-jenkins-enterprise-platform-observability`
- **Smart Alarms**: CPU utilization, response time, Jenkins job metrics
- **Log Groups**: 
  - `/jenkins/${environment}/application` - Jenkins application logs (30-day retention)
  - `/jenkins/${environment}/system` - System logs (14-day retention)
- **S3 Log Storage**: Long-term archival with intelligent lifecycle policies

### CloudWatch Components
- **Dashboard**: `${environment}-jenkins-enterprise-platform-dashboard`
- **Log Groups**: 
  - `/jenkins/${environment}/application` - Jenkins application logs
  - `/jenkins/${environment}/system` - System logs
  - `/jenkins/${environment}/user-data` - Instance initialization logs
  - `/aws/vpc/flowlogs/${environment}-jenkins-enterprise-platform` - VPC flow logs

### Cost-Optimized Observability Configuration

**Smart Monitoring Setup** (`modules/cost-optimized-observability/`):
```hcl
# CloudWatch Dashboard with infrastructure metrics
dashboard_name = "${environment}-jenkins-enterprise-platform-observability"

# Intelligent alarms with SNS notifications
cpu_threshold = 80          # CPU utilization alarm
response_time_threshold = 2 # Response time alarm (seconds)

# Log retention policies
application_log_retention = 30  # days
system_log_retention = 14      # days

# S3 lifecycle for cost optimization
log_archive_days = 30      # Move to IA storage
log_glacier_days = 90      # Move to Glacier
log_expiry_days = 365      # Delete after 1 year
```

**Monthly Cost Breakdown**:
```bash
Cost-Optimized Observability: ~$15/month
├── CloudWatch metrics + alarms: $8/month
├── CloudWatch logs (retention): $3/month  
├── S3 storage with lifecycle: $2/month
├── SNS notifications: $1/month
└── Data transfer: $1/month

vs Enterprise ECS Stack: ~$120/month
💰 SAVINGS: $105/month (87% reduction)
```
